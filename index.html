    <p>
    The site has a Javascript ,"Submit Assignment" buttons, so that the user can click to submit his/her assignment. After clicking on that button, the status changes into "already submitted", which shows the user that the submittion is completed. Also, when user tries to leave the page, it prompts a question whether to leave the page or not. In addition to that, when assignments are completed, the site shifts the tasks on the To DO list up ward and removes the ones that has been completed.
